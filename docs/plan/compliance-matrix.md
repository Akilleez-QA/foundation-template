> Organized after [NPR 7150.2D](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayAll.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_7150_002D_&page_name=all), [NASA-STD-8739.8B](https://standards.nasa.gov/standard/nasa/nasa-std-87398) and the [NASA Software Engineering Handbook](https://swehb.nasa.gov/display/SWEHBVD/7.18+-+Documentation+Guidance) documentation guidance. This is not a NASA compliance determination or certification. The software classification is a self-assessed analog (Class E, not safety-critical); no NASA authority, independent verification and validation, or hazard analysis is asserted. The document describes the implementation inspected at the baseline commit.

Self-assessed class: Class E analog, not safety-critical ([SMP §1](software-management-plan.md#1-software-classification-self-assessed)). A Foundation copied from this template re-assesses its own class; one that carries engineering data keeps the Class D-analog sentence (as foundation-refrigeration does). Baseline: Class E with voluntary adoption of the Class D documentation set. The "NPR classes" column comes from a text extraction of NPR 7150.2D Appendix C; check edge cases against the official document before citing them.
